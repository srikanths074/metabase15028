  native query, but that change in timezone is not conveyed through the BigQuery API. In most situations
  `*bigquery-timezone*` will just be UTC. If the user is always changing the timezone via native SQL function
  invocation, they can set their JVM TZ to the correct timezone, mark `use-jvm-timezone` to `true` and that will bind
