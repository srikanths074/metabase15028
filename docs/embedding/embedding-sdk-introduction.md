# Embedding SDK (BETA)

{% include plans-blockquote.html feature="Embedding SDK" %}

> The Metabase embedding SDK is currently in beta, but you should check it out and kick the tires; you can do a lot of [cool stuff with it](#example-apps-built-with-the-embedding-sdk).

With the [Embedding SDK](./embedding-sdk-introduction.md), you can embed individual Metabase components with React (like standalone charts, dashboards, the query builder, and more). You can manage access and interactivity per component, and you have advanced customization for seamless styling.

## Embedding SDK on NPM

Check out the [Metabase embedding SDK on NPM: [metaba.se/sdk](https://metaba.se/sdk).

## Example apps built with the embedding SDK

To give you and idea of what's possible with the SDK, we've put together example sites at [metaba.se/sdk-demo](https://metaba.se/sdk-demo). Navigate between three different shop websites: The Stitch, Luminara Beauty, and Pug & Play. Check them out and poke around their products and analytics sections, as well as the New Question and New Dashboard options.
